What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems to ensure reliability, efficiency, and scalability. Software engineering is crucial in the technology industry because it ensures the creation of high-quality, maintainable, and secure software solutions.

Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)

Introduction of structured programming languages like C and Pascal.
Encouraged better coding practices, improving maintainability.
The Agile Manifesto (2001)

Shift from rigid development processes to adaptive, iterative approaches.
Emphasized collaboration, customer feedback, and flexibility in software development.
The Rise of DevOps (2010s-Present)

Integration of development and operations for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Automation of testing and deployment processes, improving efficiency.
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining project requirements.
Planning – Creating a roadmap, timeline, and resource allocation.
Design – Developing architecture and design specifications.
Implementation (Coding) – Writing and developing the software.
Testing – Ensuring functionality, security, and performance.
Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance – Fixing bugs and updating features over time.
Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
Feature	Waterfall	Agile
Approach	Sequential	Iterative
Flexibility	Low	High
Feedback Incorporation	At the end	Continuous
Documentation	Heavy	Lightweight
Best Use Cases	Large-scale, regulated projects	Dynamic, fast-changing environments
Example Scenarios:

Waterfall: Government software projects, healthcare systems where documentation is crucial.
Agile: Mobile apps, e-commerce platforms requiring frequent updates.
Roles in a Software Engineering Team
Software Developer: Designs, writes, and maintains code.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software for bugs and ensures quality.
Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, resources, and stakeholder communication.
Importance of IDEs and VCS
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools like syntax highlighting, debugging, and code completion.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Track changes, enable collaboration, and allow rollback to previous versions.
Examples: Git, SVN.
Challenges Faced by Software Engineers & Solutions
Managing Changing Requirements – Use Agile methodologies for adaptability.
Debugging Complex Issues – Utilize debugging tools and peer code reviews.
Time Constraints – Prioritize tasks and use project management tools.
Types of Software Testing
Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., testing a function in isolation).
Integration Testing: Ensures components work together (e.g., testing API connections).
System Testing: Evaluates the complete system’s functionality.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets user requirements.
Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective input prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It is crucial for optimizing AI interactions in areas like chatbots, automation, and content generation.

Example of a Vague vs. Improved Prompt
Vague Prompt: “Tell me about AI.”
Improved Prompt: “Explain artificial intelligence, its types, and real-world applications in healthcare and finance.”
Why is the improved prompt better?

It specifies the topic (AI).
It defines key aspects (types and applications).
It provides context (healthcare and finance), making the AI response more targeted.
